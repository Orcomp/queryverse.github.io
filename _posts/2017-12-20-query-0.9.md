I just released [Query.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/Query.jl)
v0.9.0. The new version adds the ``@take`` and ``@drop`` standalone query
operators and brings pretty printing to uncollected queries.

## Pretty printing

In previous versions queries displayed a really awful mess of internal
data when they were displayed in the REPL. In practice one always had to
collect a query into something like a ``DataFrame`` to get a nice view
of the query result. The new version changes that and provides a nice
output for any query, even an uncollected one. Here is an example:

````julia
julia> using FileIO, Query, CSVFiles

julia> filename = "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/davidanthoff/bebfd24c1a3f32f576eb61bee77f5944/raw/dd9233ad860037a2155f3a9ca3c37eb2d5572573/testdata2.csv";

julia> load(filename) |> @map({_.Year, _.Cause_Name})
15028x2 query result
Year │ Cause_Name
─────┼───────────────────────
1999 │ Unintentional Injuries
1999 │ Unintentional Injuries
1999 │ Unintentional Injuries
1999 │ Unintentional Injuries
1999 │ Unintentional Injuries
1999 │ Unintentional Injuries
1999 │ Unintentional Injuries
1999 │ Unintentional Injuries
1999 │ Unintentional Injuries
1999 │ Unintentional Injuries
... with 15018 more rows
````

The pretty printing should work for the values returned from any of the
query operators. The output format is heavily inspired by R’s tibbles.

I hope this will make interactive work much more pleasant because it
should be easier to build up more complicated queries step by step, while
periodically running a query to check intermediate results.

I also plan to add this to the whole tabular file IO of the iterable
tables ecosystem at a later date (e.g. [CSVFiles.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/CSVFiles.jl),
[FeatherFiles.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/FeatherFiles.jl),
[ExcelFiles.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/ExcelFiles.jl),
[StatFiles.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/StatFiles.jl) etc.).

## The @take and @drop query commands

Those are fairly straightforward: both of these filter elements out of a
sequence. ``@take`` limits the number of elements to some upper maximum,
and ``@drop`` skips a number of elements. Here is an example of how one
can use these:

````julia
using FileIO, Query, CSVFiles

filename = "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/davidanthoff/bebfd24c1a3f32f576eb61bee77f5944/raw/dd9233ad860037a2155f3a9ca3c37eb2d5572573/testdata2.csv"

load(filename) |>
    @filter(_.Cause_Name!="All Causes" && !isnull(_.Age_adjusted_Death_Rate)) |>
    @groupby(_.Cause_Name) |>
    @map({cause=_.key, death_rate=sum(_..Age_adjusted_Death_Rate)}) |>
    @orderby_descending(_.death_rate) |>
    @drop(2) |>
    @take(3) |>
    save("output.feather")
````

This example showcases a whole range of features, including the use of
the ``@drop`` and ``@take`` operations. The official documentation for
these two new operators is in the "Experimental Features" section in the
[Query.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/Query.jl) [documentation](http://www.david-anthoff.com/Query.jl/stable/).

Any feedback on these new features (and old ones) is most welcome, and of
course any help with the overall package would also be fantastic!

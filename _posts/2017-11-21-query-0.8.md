I just released [Query.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/Query.jl)
v0.8.0. The new version has some breaking renames in the experimental
parts of the package (that is why they are experimental!), extends the
set of experimental standalone query commands, adds a slight twist to
the experimental anonymous function syntax and ships with a whole bunch
of package refactoring under the hood.

## Renamed experimental standalone query commands

The ``@select`` standalone command was renamed to ``@map``, and the
``@where`` command to ``@filter``. Those names are more in line with
julia conventions.

This change only applies to the experimental standalone versions of the
query commands that you would use with the pipe operator. Nothing has
changed about the LINQ syntax, i.e. that part will retain the SQL-like
terms from LINQ. I have no plans to change those terms going forward,
i.e. this does not indicate that there are any breaking changes planned
for the stable part of LINQ.

## New experimental standalone query commands

This release adds support for the ``@groupjoin``, ``@join`` and
``@mapmany`` standalone query commands, i.e. you can now use those with
the pipe syntax. [This](http://www.david-anthoff.com/Query.jl/stable/experimental.html#Standalone-query-operators-1)
part of the documentation describes the arguments to those commands.

## Support for two arguments in the experimental anonymous function syntax

Some of new standalone query commands require an anonymous function that
takes two arguments. The existing experimental shortcut syntax for
creating anonymous functions has been extended to support that scenario.
To create a two argument anonymous function, you simply have to use both
``_`` and ``__`` (double underscore) in the expression that should be
turned into an anonymous function. For example ``{a=_, b=__}`` will be
translated into ``(i1,i2)->{a=i1, b=i2}``.

## Package refactoring

This release continues the breakup of the very large package
[Query.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/Query.jl) into smaller packages
that do specific things. The current situation now is this:

* [IteratorInterfaceExtensions.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/IteratorInterfaceExtensions.jl)
defines a number of small extensions to the base julia iterator interface
that are used by both [Query.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/Query.jl)
and the iterable tables universe.
* [QueryOperators.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/QueryOperators.jl)
contains the definition of the query operators and the default iterator
based backend implementation.
* [Query.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/Query.jl) now contains the
syntax for the two supported front-ends: the traditional LINQ style
syntax and the new experimental standalone commands.
* [TableTraits.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/TableTraits.jl) defines
a very minimal interface for tabular data interop.
* [TableTraitsUtils.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/TableTraitsUtils.jl)
provides some helper functions that make it easier to implement the
interface defined in [TableTraits.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/TableTraits.jl).
Some packages use this to implement the table traits interface, but
others donâ€™t need it.
* [IterableTables.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/IterableTables.jl)
contains all the integrations for various packages with the iterable
tables ecosystem that have not yet moved into those packages themselves.

This refactoring significantly simplifies the dependency situation with
these packages. The dependency graph now looks roughly like this:
````

                                             IterableTables
                                            /
                                           /- TableTraitUtils
                                          /
                              TableTraits
                            /
IteratorInterfaceExtensions
                            \
                              QueryOperators
                                            \
                                             Query
````

## Thanks

Thanks as always to all the folks that contributed to this effort with
bug reports, suggestions and PRs. This release also got some new
benchmarks that were contributed by [floswald](https://discourse.julialang.org/u/floswald)
that will hopefully trigger some performance improvements going forward.

Please do report any bugs and suggestions back! And help with this whole
effort is of course also always most welcome.

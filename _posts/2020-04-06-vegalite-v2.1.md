I just released [VegaLite.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/VegaLite.jl) v2.1. While this release just tracks what is happening upstream in the Vega-Lite project, there are some really nice feature additions.

For all the details you can read through the release notes of Vega-Lite:

- [Vega-Lite 4.7](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/releases/tag/v4.7.0)
- [Vega-Lite 4.8](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/releases/tag/v4.8.0)
- [Vega-Lite 4.9](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/releases/tag/v4.9.0)
- [Vega-Lite 4.10](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/releases/tag/v4.10.0)

I'll use the rest of this post to highlight a few key new features.

## Arc marks

Vega-Lite now supports a new arc mark that makes it easy to create pie, donut and radial charts:

For more information, you can read the original Vega-Lite [documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/arc.html) and you can look at a number of [Julia examples](https://www.queryverse.org/VegaLite.jl/v2.1/examples/examples_circular_plots/).

## Datum in encoding

The new support for [datum in encodings](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/datum.html) makes it easy to add for example a rule at a given point to a figure.

An example that adds a horizontal rule to a figure is this:

```julia
using VegaLite, VegaDatasets

dataset("stocks") |>
@vlplot() +
@vlplot(:line, "date:t", :price, color=:symbol) +
@vlplot(mark={:rule, strokeDash=[2,2], size=2}, y={datum=300})
```

![figure](/assets/blog/images/datum_horizontal.svg)

Note how the `y` channel here is given a `datum`, that is a value from the underlying price domain.

For temporal values this has especially nice syntax:

```julia
using VegaLite, VegaDatasets

dataset("stocks") |>
@vlplot() +
@vlplot(:line, "date:t", :price, color=:symbol) +
@vlplot(mark={:rule, strokeDash=[2,2], size=2}, x={datum={year=2006}})
```

Note how we can set a value for a specific year here.

## Angle channel for point and text marks

A new angle channel makes it easy to create for example the following wind vector map:

You can find the Julia code for this example in the [documentation](https://www.queryverse.org/VegaLite.jl/v2.1/examples/examples_table_based_plots/#Wind-Vector-Map-1).

## Conclusion

This release was literally zero work on the Julia side of things, all the thanks for these new features should go to the awesome Vega-Lite team that keeps adding new functionality at an amazing speed!

                <h3>Package Documentation</h3>
                <p>All packages in the Queryverse are completely documented.
                    That documentation is accessible via the github homepage
                    for each individual package. For some packages the documentation
                    is simply the README file, other (more complicated) packages
                    have more extensive documentation.</p>

                    is the beginning of a book that covers Queryverse. At
                    this point the emphasis is on "beginning": so far only
                    a few chapters have been written, so this is not a
                    comprehensive introduction yet. But the material that
                    is available at this point should be useful.</p>

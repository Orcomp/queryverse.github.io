          The setup for these runs is still a work in progress and there
          are a number of caveats that apply to the current set of results.
          Please don't yet cite them or take them too serious until we
          have sorted out all remaining benchmarking issues. The
          replication code for these results can be found at

          The raw timing data can be downloaded from <a href="/benchmarkresults/csvreader.csv">here</a>.

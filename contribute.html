                <h3>Help other users</h3>
                <p>Many users ask questions about Queryverse packages in various
                    online forums. Answering their questions and helping them
                    with their problems is an excellent way to contribute
                    to the Queryverse!
                </p>

                <p>The main online places where Queryverse users ask questions
                    are the <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/data">Data category</a> on the general
                    <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/">Julia Discourse forum</a> and the data channel
                    in the Julia <a href="https://julialang.slack.com/"></a>Slack room.

                <h3>Create Learning Materials</h3>
                <p>Writing more documentation, better tutorials, or creating
                    other learning materials like video tutorials is another
                    fantastic way to help with the Queryverse.
                </p>

                <p>For packages that have their documentation in their
                    README.md file, you can simple open a pull request
                    with a change to that README file to incorporate
                    your improvement.
                </p>

                <p>Packages that have more extensive documentation typically
                    have a docs folder that contains Markdown files with
                    the documentation. To make contributions there, simply
                    open a PR with edits against these Markdown files.

                <p>If you created some learning content that is hosted on

                    <h3>Find bugs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every software has bugs, and the Queryverse is no
                        exception. If you find one, please report it back
                        to us. Bug reports from the real world are incredibly
                        valuable. The best way to report a bug is to open
                        an issue in the github repository for the package
                        with the bug.

                    <h3>Work on the code of the packages</h3>
                    <p>
                        We greatly value help with the actual code of the
                        packages themselves! The general workflow there is
                        simple: just open a PR with your improvement on
                        the relevant package github repository. If you plan
                        to make larger changes, it is probably a good idea
                        to first open an issue where we can discuss such
                        proposals before you start to work on the actual
                        code.
